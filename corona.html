	<h4> The outdoor option </h4>
		<p>
			In many countries across the world, social distancing is encouraged in order to curb the spread of the corona virus. Sadly, this means that in many countries bouldering gyms are closed. How can you keep you keep up the bouldering spirit in these challenging times? <br><br>
			Some governments still allow for going into nature, as long as the minimum physical distance is maintained. If this is the case for you, head out to a nearby bouldering site, or see if you can find a forest with good climbing trees! Of course, make sure you keep your distance to others, and check to see if that branch can <em>really</em> cary your weight before you rely on it!

		<h4> The stay-at-home option </h4>
		<p>
			Some people have built climbing walls in their home! <br> <img src="https://coresites-cdn-adm.imgix.net/mpora_new/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bouldering-Wall-Loft-House.jpg?fit=crop&w=702&h=450" width="420"> <br>
			For most people with 'normal' homes, climbing at home is a bit too far fetched. However, that's no excuse to stay fit and ready to climb again in the future! Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChGP5ahvvN4"> this video</a> on YouTube for a good workout.
