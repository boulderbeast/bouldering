		<p> Bouldering is a climbing sport that can be practiced both indoor and outdoors. In contrast to lead climbing where you climb up tall walls, bouldering is characterized by short, explosive routes. <br> I first started bouldering a bit more than a year ago. At first I thought it was terrifying, but now I love it! <br><br>

		<h2> What's so special about bouldering? </h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li> You climb small rock formations or artificial rock walls </li>
				<li> Routes are max. 4.5 meters high </li>
				<li> No ropes are used (but if you fall, a mat will catch you) </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2> Three reasons to start bouldering </h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li> You can climb with friends, regardless of their skill or fitness level</li>
				<li> There are routes for each level, so you can always find something that isn't too hard but still challenges you</li>
				<li> People in bouldering gyms are generally very willing to help you if you're stuck! </li>
			</ol>
